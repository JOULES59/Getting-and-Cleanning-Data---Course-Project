Course Project:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


Step work with the script run_analysis.R:

1. Set your working directory:  
   Use the setwd() function in Rstudio.
2. Download the data source and put in the working directory. You will have a 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder.
3. Run the script 'run_analysis.R' from your working directory.
4. You yield a new file 'tidy_data.txt' in your working directory.
